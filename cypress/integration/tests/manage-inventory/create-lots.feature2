Feature: Create Inventory Lots
  As a user with Manage inventory permission
  I want to create inventory lots so I can match them into existing germplasm in the system

Background:
  Given germplasm records already exists
  # NOTE: There is already a common step def that exists for the step above
  # but need to add code to store GID of the imported germplasm as an env variable
  # to use in specifying GID on create lots form
  And I am on the Manage Inventory page of specified program

@TestCaseKey=IBP-T495
@smoke-test
Scenario: Create new lot with initial deposit amount
  When I navigate to create lots screen
  And I specified valid values for lot details
  And I enable initial deposit
  And I specify valid deposit details
  # Note: Avoid hard coding the values in the page object functions,
  # instead pass them as argument from the step def
  And I save the new lot
  Then I should be able to see that the new lot has been created successfully
  # Assert response code of POST lots api call to be 200 and the success message that will display after saving lots
