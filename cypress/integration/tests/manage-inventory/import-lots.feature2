Feature: Import Inventory Lots
  As a user with Manage inventory permission
  I want to import inventory lots so I can match them into existing germplasm in the system

Background:
  Given germplasm records already exists
  # NOTE: There is already a common step def that exists for the step above
  # but need to add code to store GID of the imported germplasm as an env variable
  # to use in specifying GID on import lots template
  And I am on the Manage Inventory page of specified program

@TestCaseKey=IBP-T496

Scenario: Create new lot with initial deposit amount
  When I navigate to import lots screen
  And I download an import lot template file
  And I upload the lot template file with complete and valid details
  And I import the lot
  Then I should be able to see that the lot has been imported successfully
  # Assert response code of POST lots api call to be 200 and the success message that will display after importing lots
