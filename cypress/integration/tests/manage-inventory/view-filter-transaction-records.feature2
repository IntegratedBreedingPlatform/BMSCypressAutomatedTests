Feature: View and Filter Transaction Records
  As a user with Manage inventory permission
  I want to view and filter transaction records
Background:
  Given germplasm list with lot records already exists
  # TODO: Create common step def for importing germplasm list with lot records and save list name and GID as env variables
  # in common-germplasm-import-step-defs
  And I am on the Manage Inventory page of specified program

@TestCaseKey=IBP-T499
@smoke-test
Scenario: View and filter lot records by germplasm list
  When I navigate to transaction records page
  And I filter lot records by GID
  # Use GID of imported germplasm with inventory records from common step def
  Then I should be able to see that the transaction records were filtered successfully
  # Assert response code of GET transaction/search api call returns 200
  # and transaction records table have the expected number of records
