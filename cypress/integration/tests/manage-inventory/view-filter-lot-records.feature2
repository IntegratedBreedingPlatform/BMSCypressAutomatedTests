Feature: View and Filter Lots Records
  As a user with Manage inventory permission
  I want to view and filter inventory lots so I review my inventory data accordingly

Background:
  Given germplasm list with lot records already exists
  # TODO: Create common step def for importing germplasm list with lot records and save list name and GID as env variables
  # in common-germplasm-import-step-defs
  And I am on the Manage Inventory page of specified program

@TestCaseKey=IBP-T494
@smoke-test
Scenario: View and filter lot records by germplasm list
  When I navigate to lot records page
  And I filter lot records by a germplasm list
  # Select name of the germplasm list with existing inventory records
  Then I should be able to see that the lot records were filtered successfully
  # Assert response code of GET lot/search api call returns 200
  # and lot records table have the expected number of records
